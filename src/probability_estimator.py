"""
This file contains a probability estimator method. Given a phenotype-genotype
pair within the context of a graph, and some statistics for different types
of path linking connected and disconnected pairs within the graph, it estimates
the probability that the pair is directly connected by a gene.
This file also contains a method for extracting the aforementioned path type
statistics from some data files, representing the alternative paths that link
together some phenotype-genotype pairs from a subset of the graph.
